##Idea
So what is the idea?
A pasting and code editting site.
 - Drag and drop files to the page
 - First time, creates a link for you to share with people
 - Chat to talk while you look at code
 - link to files and code lines 
 - able to edit files simultaniously with friends (like google docs)

The problem: it is hard to share and discuss code online
Available ways to do it:

- Github gists -> can't chat, can't comment on specific lines
- Google docs -> terrible for code, very convulated sharing
- Pastebin -> just simple text

All of these solutions make it impossible to, for example, post your code for a programming solution on facebook (link it to the challenges for interview group)
